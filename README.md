# Geonetwork Opensource Guides

I'm the administrator and maintainer of the [National Antarctic Data Center](https://antarcticdatacenter.cnr.it) by the National Research Council of Italy. The NADC is based on the [Geonetwork-Opensource](https://geonetwork-opensource.org/) catalog application.

In my daily activities I faced and solved a lot of issues with the application and I decided to share here my findings, hoping to save some other maintainer's time.
